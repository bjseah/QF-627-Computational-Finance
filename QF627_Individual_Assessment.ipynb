    "> Good evening, Team. 👋\n",

    "> This assessment is prepared so that you may review what you have learned on the course. You can find the answers from the lessons and from the scripts of each lesson that you have received throughout the course. Please do not feel yourselves to be under pressure. `Read each question carefully and answer accordingly`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using Python in real-world financial data analysis does not mean simply executing a single step of an independent chunk of code. It requires a chain of lines of codes with a sharp logical progression. To give you a good exercise in real-world practice, the questions here, just like all the lessons and exercise problem sets, require you to go through `inter-related` and `logically deduced lines of programming`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "> Below are 10 questions. Each question asks you to program a sequence of codes that lead to an answer. First `ensure you fully understand the question`, in order not to overlook essential processes and answers. When questions ask for answers in addition to lines of codes, provide them using a markdown cell.\n",

    "> Be sure to submit your work before the deadline: `9:30pm tonight, November 8, 2022`. It is an open-book exercise, and is also a timed task. To be fair to all students, a late submission will incur a point reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Please note `your last name` for `naming your submission` file (e.g., `Roh.ipynb`)\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you find that you cannot answer a question, it would be wise to move on to another question that you can answer, and to finish that one first. `Make the best use of the time available`. If you cannot fully answer all the questions, then do as much as you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "> Under a relative grading scheme, not everyone can receive an A grade for the course. This is school policy. If you find the questions easy, that does not guarantee your good final performance. If you find the questions a bit difficult, that is so that you may be given a valid and fair assessment. `It does not mean that you are failing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
